List of topics to potentially be included on the Wiki...

Meta

    between each of of the major daws.
- getting help
- contributing
  - basic tutorial on how to use clone repo, make change, push them, submit a PR, and
    then pull upstream change later on.

Bitwig
------

Where possible, it may be useful to structure the Bitwig wiki in a similar manner to how
things are organized in Bitwig itself, or in the Bitwig manual.

When creating topic-specific pages such as those below, one could consider linking to
relevant Youtube tutorials to make it easy for users to find more information on each
topic.

- audio
  - audio clips/events
  - bouncing
  - recording
- instruments
  - polysynth
  - fm4
- effects
  - each effect could have its own page with an overview + tips & tricks / recipes / etc.
  - another useful effects-related page could be an (opinionated) overview of which
    bitwig stock effects are good on their own, and which ones are not-so-great, for
    which users may want to look to third-party vsts.
- automation
- midi
- modulation
- grid
- keyboard shortcuts
- settings
- ui
- templates
